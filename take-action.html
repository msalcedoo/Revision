    According to that big clock in Union Square, we only have until July 21, 2029 to decrease our emissions in order to stay below the critical threshold of 1.5Â°C of global warming.
    <br/><br/>
    Changes are in motion to lower carbon emissions. Companies like L'Oreal are aiming to use 100% renewable energy by 2025. Microsoft claims to already be carbon net zero, and aims to be carbon negative in 2030. There are also numerous other companies that pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. Obviously, these are just pledges, it's up to us to hold them accountable. Things like driving EVs, or putting up solar panels in your house are helpful, but large-scale change has to come from big corporations. We must urge our corporations and governments to remain committed to lowering emissions.
