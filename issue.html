    Greenhouse gases are one of the main contributors to climate change. Known as the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases trap and and absorb the Sun's heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In 2022, China and the United States accounted for around 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the top ten countries contribute to more than 68% of emissions.

        The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) claims that between 1880 and 2012, human activity has cause Earth's temperature to rise by 1.66 degrees Fahrenheit. As temperatures continue to rise, there may be changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. All these effects are collectively known as climate change.
